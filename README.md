Documentation on how to setup various forms of our KC3ESS amateur radio DSTAR repeater.

In this repository you will find all of the documentation we used during the setup of various forms of the KC3ESS Repeater.

Each form of the repeater is in a seperate folder.
Some folders apply to all forms of the repeater, such as the G4KLX Documentation for ircDDBGateway and dstarrepeater software.

I do NOT own any of the software used. All software is licensed by their respective developers and you should follow all rules in accordance with those licenses.

I only ask that if you share the documentation I have created, that you give me credit.
