# KC3ESS DSTAR Repeater - Pi-Star Documentation

Documentation on how we setup our amateur radio DSTAR repeater using Pi-Star.

In this repository you will find all of the documentation we used during the setup of Pi-Star.

I do NOT own any of the software used. All software is licensed by their respective developers and you should adhere to their license requirements.

I only ask that if you share the documentation I have created, that you give me credit. See note below.

NOTE: Some documents/files may have been pulled from other websites. 
  -	  Such files should have a source or note listed in this "README.md" file. 
  -   If the file is not my own creation, the original owner's license applies and should be referred to.
