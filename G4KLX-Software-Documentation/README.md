# G4KLX Software Documentation for KC3ESS Repeater

This folder will contain all the documentation we have created in regards to setting up the G4KLX ircDDBGateway and DSTARRepeater software for the KC3ESS Repeater.

The sendipaddress.py file was pulled from the Maryland DSTAR image and edited to include some setup information as well as the necessary code to send the public IP address instead of the private IP address.
